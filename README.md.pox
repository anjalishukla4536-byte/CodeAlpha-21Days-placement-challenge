# Day 6 – Pow(x, n)

## Problem
Implement the function pow(x, n), which calculates x raised to the power n.

## Approach
I used binary exponentiation to compute the power efficiently.
The exponent is reduced by half in each step.
For negative exponents, the base is inverted.
This method avoids repeated multiplication and improves performance.

## Time Complexity
O(log n)

## Space Complexity
O(1)
